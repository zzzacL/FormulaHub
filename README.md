# FormulaHub v0.06
FormulaHub is a basic Python program made for me to practice my programming skills. Works best with monospaced fonts

Help List:

	#help: Brings up this list.
	#list: Brings up the list of all formulas.
	#salist: Brings up Surface Area Formula list
	#vollist: Brings up Volume Formula list
	#trilist: Brings up Trig Formula list
	#vislist: Brings up Visualizer list

<h1>Update v0.06!</h1>
	This update cleaned up the feel of the program by not making it take up 1,000,000 lines in your termainal. I will also start doing little update logs like this.

For any help or criticisms of my terrible code, contact me on Twitter @zaciskewl
