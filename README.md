# FormulaHub v0.08
FormulaHub is a basic Python program made for me to practice my programming skills. Works best with monospaced fonts

Help List:

	#help: Brings up this list.
	#list: Brings up the list of all formulas.
	#salist: Brings up Surface Area Formula list
	#vollist: Brings up Volume Formula list
	#trilist: Brings up Trig Formula list
	#vislist: Brings up Visualizer list

<h1>Update v0.09!</h1>
	Added auto OS selection, added a new configuration for decimal places and I might create an accompanying config file later.
	plans: I should probably turn the program into multiple loops rather than one big loop, which may require a rewrite... I'll deal with that later, but until then I just need to worry about adding more and more formulas.

<h2>Update v0.08.5!</h2>
	Forgot to remove some simplify some print() functions.

<h1>Update v0.08!</h1>
	Did a major rewrite of the logic within the program, added some functions and another while loop. I also removed large print walls to clean up the file. During the original release, back when I was interested in the formulas rather than user convenience, I completely forgot about sphere volume formula, so selecting "sphere" would cause the program to use the surface area formula. In reality, that was a fun logical exercise, and I hope for more in the future. More formulas coming soon! Also maybe pages!

<h2>Update v0.07!</h2>
	Removed the complete list of formulas from being printed before an operating system is selected, and fixed the formula for spheres. Added a function to remove a lot of repeated code!
	
<h3>Update v0.06!</h3>
	This update cleaned up the feel of the program by not making it take up 1,000,000 lines in your termainal. I will also start doing little update logs like this.
