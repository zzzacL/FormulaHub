# FormulaHub v0.11
FormulaHub is a basic Python program made for me to practice my programming skills. Works best with monospaced fonts. Has not been "chmod +x"'d, sorry!!

Help List:

	#logo: Brings up the sick Unicode logo.
	#help: Brings up this list.
	#list: Brings up the list of all formulas.
	#salist: Brings up Surface Area Formula list.
	#vollist: Brings up Volume Formula list.
	#triglist: Brings up Trig Formula list.
	#al2list: Brings up Algebra II Formula list.
	#vislist: Brings up Visualizer list.
	#settings: Brings up Settings.

Settings List:

	@deci: Allows for decimal place configuration(0-13 places)
	@ptri: Configure the levels of Pascal's Triangle(0-12 rows)

<h1>Update v0.11!</h1>
	Added a new list!! The Algebra II list. It has 3 new formulas, Multiplication/ Division of powers and the Discriminant to compliment the moved-around Quadtratic Formula. Also, Pascal's Triangle!! You can now have a visual representation of Pascal's Triangle in the #vislist up to 12 rows (default: 8), which is probably more than anyone will ever need, but it's available in a cool python list!
	
<h2>Update v0.10!</h2>
	Organized the lists, fixed a formula, added Slope with optional angle, Point distance and the Quadratic formula. I also documented and organized the code better within the program. The next updates will add more advanced formulas from Algebra II and Pre-Calculus/ Trig.

<h3>Update v0.09!</h3>
	Added auto OS selection, added a new configuration for decimal places and I might create an accompanying config file later.
	plans: I should probably turn the program into multiple loops rather than one big loop, which may require a rewrite... I'll deal with that later, but until then I just need to worry about adding more and more formulas.

<h3>Update v0.08.5!</h3>
	Forgot to remove some simplify some print() functions.

<h3>Update v0.08!</h3>
	Did a major rewrite of the logic within the program, added some functions and another while loop. I also removed large print walls to clean up the file. During the original release, back when I was interested in the formulas rather than user convenience, I completely forgot about sphere volume formula, so selecting "sphere" would cause the program to use the surface area formula. In reality, that was a fun logical exercise, and I hope for more in the future. More formulas coming soon! Also maybe pages!

<h3>Update v0.07!</h3>
	Removed the complete list of formulas from being printed before an operating system is selected, and fixed the formula for spheres. Added a function to remove a lot of repeated code!
	
<h3>Update v0.06!</h3>
	This update cleaned up the feel of the program by not making it take up 1,000,000 lines in your termainal. I will also start doing little update logs like this.
